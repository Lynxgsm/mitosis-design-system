# Web components vs Mitosis

## TODO

- Export icons and styles
- ds-themes to contain colors (separated folder part & pro)
- Change output folder of react app
- Build with vite

## GOALS

Principles:

A Component should be:

- cross-libraries but the code should be written once.
- have a minimum style but easy to extend it via CSS by any dev.
- provide some optional themes to make it easy to use.
- be accessible (FUTURE RELEASES).
- be made for developers not for non-coders, they will decide how to style most of the things.
- be tree-shakable.
- be compatible with StoryBook.
- be inspired by other UI Libraries and don't reinvent the wheel.
- be easy to create new variants.
